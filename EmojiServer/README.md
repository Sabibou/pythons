# Emoji Server

A simple script that helps you refer to Github emojis offline. It uses the excellent [http://emoji.muan.co](http://emoji.muan.co) and runs it on localhost.


## Setting Up

* [Download zip](https://github.com/muan/emoji/archive/gh-pages.zip) from [muan/emoji](https://github.com/muan/emoji). Place it in the same folder as `EmojiServer.py`. That is, EmojiServer.py and index.html should be in the same folder.


## Using

* Run `EmojiServer.py`
* The script should create the local server and open the browser automatically.


**Note** - You can change the default browser in the script's config section.
