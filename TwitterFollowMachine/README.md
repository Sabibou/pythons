# Twitter Follow Machine

This script gets in some root accounts and follows their followers. For example, if you want to follow tech users from India, you put 'MozillaIn' and 'googleindia' as root accounts 
and start the game.

You can configure the max limit of users to follow and the root accounts in the script. 
In addition to that, you will have to register an app on Twitter for the access tokens, consumer keys and stuff.

This script requires `tweepy` library to be installed.

```
pip install tweepy
```
